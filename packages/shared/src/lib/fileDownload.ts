/**
 * Pure, DOM-free contract for exporting JSON blobs to the user's file
 * system. Mirrors the R7 haptic adapter pattern (see
 * `./haptic.ts`): consumers (UI components, feature modules, domain
 * packages) call `downloadJson(filename, payload)` without caring
 * whether they're running in a browser (`Blob` + `URL.createObjectURL`
 * + `a.click()`) or a React Native app (eventually:
 * `expo-file-system.writeAsStringAsync` in the cache directory plus
 * `expo-sharing.shareAsync`).
 *
 * The app shell registers the appropriate adapter once at startup via
 * `setFileDownloadAdapter`. Until an adapter registers, a built-in
 * no-op is active so that calls from SSR, unit tests, or pure domain
 * code are safe — the default emits a single `console.warn` in
 * development builds so misconfigurations surface early, and is
 * completely silent in production.
