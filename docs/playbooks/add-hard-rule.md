**Trigger:** "Add a new Hard Rule" / "Add a new mandatory convention" / any rule that should be enforced across all contributors and AI agents.

## Steps

### 1. Claim the next rule number

Before writing content, **pull latest `main`** and find the current highest rule number:

```bash
git pull origin main
grep -E '^### [0-9]+\.' AGENTS.md | tail -1
```

Use `N+1` as your new rule number. Do **not** claim a number without checking first — merge races can cause slot collisions (this happened with PR #1144 / #1146).

### 2. Write the canonical entry in `AGENTS.md`

Add the rule under `## Hard rules (do not break)` in `AGENTS.md`, using this structure:

```md
### N. Short imperative title

> Why a hard rule? One paragraph explaining the problem this prevents,
> ideally linking to a real incident or PR that motivated it.

Explanation of the rule. Include:

- What to do (✅ GOOD example)
- What not to do (❌ BAD example)
- Which ESLint rule enforces it (if any)
- Which paths/modules are affected or exempt
```

Follow the style of existing rules (especially #8–#12 which have `GOOD`/`BAD` code examples).

### 3. Mirror in `CONTRIBUTING.md`

Add a one-line summary to the `### Hard rules (from AGENTS.md)` section in `CONTRIBUTING.md`:

```md
N. **Short title** — one sentence summary. Enforced by `<eslint-rule>` if applicable.
```

The `AGENTS.md` postulate says:

> All Hard Rules must be mirrored in CONTRIBUTING.md for quick reference during PR prep.

### 4. Update `CLAUDE.md` (if the rule affects AI workflow)

If the rule changes how AI agents should work (e.g., new pre-flight checks, new commands to run), update the `## Before you write code` section in `CLAUDE.md`.

### 5. Update PR template (if the rule adds a new check)

If the rule introduces a new checkbox-worthy check for PRs, add it to `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` in the appropriate section.

### 6. Add ESLint enforcement (optional but recommended)

If the rule can be mechanically detected:

1. Add or extend a rule in `packages/eslint-plugin-sergeant-design/`.
2. Tests go in `packages/eslint-plugin-sergeant-design/__tests__/`.
3. Run `pnpm lint:plugins` to verify.

### 7. Bump freshness headers

Bump the `Last validated:` date on every doc you touched.

### 8. Commit and PR

```bash
git add AGENTS.md CONTRIBUTING.md CLAUDE.md .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
git commit -m "docs(root): add Hard Rule #N — short title"
```

## Verification

- [ ] `grep -E '^### N\.' AGENTS.md` — rule exists with full content.
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` § Hard rules has the one-line mirror.
- [ ] If AI-relevant: `CLAUDE.md` updated.
- [ ] If ESLint-enforced: `pnpm lint:plugins` passes, `pnpm lint` catches violations.
- [ ] `pnpm format:check` — clean.
- [ ] No slot collisions (rule number is unique and sequential).
