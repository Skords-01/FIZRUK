# Playbook: <Title>

**Trigger:** <When to use this playbook — symptoms, alerts, or requests that activate it.>

## Decision Tree

> Follow this tree from Q1 downward. Each leaf node (→ **ACTION**) links to the detailed steps below.

**Q1: <First diagnostic question>**

- <Condition A> → <action or next question>
- <Condition B> → <action or next question>
- <Condition C> → **STOP** → <escalation / alternative playbook>

**Q2: <Second diagnostic question>**

- <Condition A> → [§N <step title>](#n-step-anchor)
- <Condition B> → [§M <step title>](#m-step-anchor)
- Unclear → gather more data ([§1](#1-first-step)) → retry Q2

<!-- Add more Qn as needed. Keep each question to 2-4 branches max. -->
