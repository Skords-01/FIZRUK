/**
 * Shared read-only pointer to the in-progress Fizruk workout.
 *
 * Fizruk persists `fizruk_active_workout_id_v1` in localStorage while a
 * workout is open. Other surfaces (Hub header, module pages, cross-module
 * CTAs) need to see that signal so they can offer a "Повернутися до
 * тренування" shortcut without pulling in the whole `useWorkouts` API.
 *
 * The active-id key is the single source of truth for "is there a session
 * to resume?", but it can end up stale in several real-world paths:
 *   - cloud-sync pulls in the completed session from another device but
 *     this device's active-id key was never cleared,
 *   - the workouts list gets wiped (FIZRUK_RESET_KEYS, manual reset, demo
 *     data cleanup) while the active-id key was missed,
 *   - a workout was ended through a non-UI path (hub chat `finish_workout`
 *     failing mid-write, cross-tab race) without clearing the active-id,
 *   - the referenced workout was deleted.
 * In all of those the banner would keep blinking "Тренування триває" even
 * though there is nothing to return to — this hook therefore validates the
 * pointer against `fizruk_workouts_v1` and treats it as `null` (and clears
 * the stale key) if the workout is missing or already has `endedAt`.
 *
 * Listens to `storage` events so that when the user ends a workout in
 * another tab the banner disappears immediately, not on next navigation.
 *
 * Also dispatches a synthetic `local-storage` event on same-tab writes
 * if callers want cross-component reactivity (Fizruk's own
 * setActiveWorkoutId dispatches via the effect that writes the key).
