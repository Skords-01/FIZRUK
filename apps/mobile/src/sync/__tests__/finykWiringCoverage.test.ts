/**
 * Cloud-sync wiring coverage manifest for the `finyk` module.
 *
 * `SYNC_MODULES.finyk` lists every MMKV key that participates in
 * cloud sync. For each key, *some* mobile writer must call
 * `enqueueChange(key)` after the persisted mutation, otherwise edits
 * never mark the module dirty and are lost on a backup restore from
 * another device.
 *
 * This manifest is the single source of truth for that audit:
 *   - WIRED keys point at the test file that already exercises the
 *     mutator end-to-end and asserts `enqueueChange(key)` fires.
 *   - PENDING_NO_WRITER keys document keys whose mobile store has not
 *     been ported yet — their wiring will land in the same PR as the
 *     store. The set is checked against the registry below so the
 *     test fails the moment a new key is added without classifying it.
 *
 * Whenever a new Finyk store ports over to mobile, move its key from
 * `PENDING_NO_WRITER` into `WIRED` and add a unit test under the
 * matching path. The test below will fail if the union of the two
 * sets ever drifts from `SYNC_MODULES.finyk.keys`.
